 COVID-19ANALYSIS

I was presentred with a data analytics project by PLP software engineering program where we were presented with a COVID19 dataset to clean,sort and analyze where we were to test our understanding of Python in carrying out data analytics.

Technologies used were 
- Matplotlib
- pandas
- Python 
- seaborn
- Github for hosting the project.

1. Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has had profound global impacts on health, economies, and societies. Even as the acute phase of the pandemic subsides, its long-term effects continue to shape various sectors. This analysis examines the key post-COVID-19 effects across different domains.

Understanding the spread, impact, and response to COVID-19 is critical for public health planning, policymaking, and future preparedness. Data analysis has been a cornerstone of this understanding, enabling stakeholders to monitor infection rates, assess healthcare capacity, and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions. From identifying hotspots to predicting trends, data has empowered decision-makers to act swiftly and adapt strategies in real time.

This analysis aims to explore key aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic, utilizing data to uncover patterns, draw insights, and provide evidence-based recommendations. Through a detailed examination of totalcase, new cases,total deaths and total vaccinations this analysis seeks to offer a comprehensive understanding of the crisis and inform future preparedness efforts.


2. ANALYSIS OBJECTIVE

This  post-COVID-19 analysis is essential to assess the effectiveness of public health interventions, and the consequences of the pandemic. Such an analysis can help uncover patterns in totalcase, new cases,total deaths and total vaccinations, providing insights that are crucial for future preparedness.

This study aims to conduct a comprehensive retrospective analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic, leveraging data to explore the following key questions in 3 countries(Kenya, India and United States)

1. What was the total impact of the spread of covid on human life
2. what impact did vaccination have
3. How fast the disease spread
4. what was the overall spread

By systematically exploring these questions, this study seeks to provide actionable insights and recommendations for strengthening global resilience against future health emergencies.

Data Handling

After loading the data, cleaning and knowing the overall structure, reduce the structure to a more manageable dataset by reducing the columns to the essentials for the analysis. The columns are totalcase, new cases,total deaths,total vaccinations, location and date.

FINDINGS

Total Deaths

Between January and May of 2020 there was a steep decline and a sudden increase in deaths in India and America. Kenya stayed relatively the same. The US death rate was the highest of all 3 countries

VACCINATIONS

We can see that the United States had a steady intake of COVID-19 vaccines, Kenya on the other hand had an irregular uptake of vaccines while India had the highest intake of the issued vaccines occasioned by sudden drops.

Cases over time 

Between January and May there was a steep decrease and then a rapid increase in COVID19 cases.US had  the highest number followed by India and then lastly Kenya whose rate remained at 0.This low rate in Kenya maybe due to a lack of comprehensive reporting 

TOTAL CASES

The US had the highest reported Cases of COVID19.

TOTAL DEATHS 

The US led with the highest number of  COVID19 related deaths 

Correlation

There is a was a mild correlation between total vaccinations with total deaths and total cases. Total deaths has a high correlation to total cases. Total vaccinations and total cases have no correlation.



Global COVID-19 Analysis: Key Findings & Policy Recommendations 

Conclusions

A retrospective study of COVID-19 outcomes in the United States, India, and Kenya highlights critical disparities in pandemic response and impact:  

1. Mortality Disparities
The U.S. reported the highest deaths and death rates, likely due to an aging population, high comorbidities, and inconsistent public health measures.  

 India and Kenya saw lower mortality rates, though underreporting (especially in Kenya) may obscure true figures.  

2. Vaccination Trends  

India led in total vaccinations but faced uneven uptake due to supply chain disruptions and hesitancy.  
The U.S. maintained steady vaccination rates, while Kenya’s rollout was erratic, reflecting access barriers and weak distribution networks.  

3. Infection Waves

All three countries experienced sharp declines followed by resurgences, suggesting:  
Initial containment measures (lockdowns, masks) were effective but short-lived.  
 New variants, premature reopening, and public fatigue contributed to recurrent waves.  

4. Data Reporting Challenges

Kenya’s low reported cases likely stem from limited testing and reporting infrastructure, masking true infection spread.  

5. Correlation Insights

Vaccinations vs. Outcomes: Weak correlation implies vaccines alone didn’t dictate case/death reductions—public health measures played a key role.  
Cases vs. Deaths: Strong correlation confirms that high infections inevitably led to higher mortality.  



Recommendations for Future Pandemic Preparedness  

1. Strengthen Healthcare Systems

- Expand ICU capacity, testing, and contact tracing to manage surges.  
- Invest in real-time data systems to avoid underreporting (e.g., Kenya’s model).  

2. Optimize Vaccination Strategies

 - Ensure consistent supply chains and combat hesitancy via community-led education.  
 - Target high-risk groups (elderly, immunocompromised) to reduce deaths.  

 3. Enhance Public Health Measures

- Early interventions (mask mandates, mobility restrictions) must be swift and adaptable.  
- Sustain public awareness campaigns to maintain compliance beyond initial outbreaks.  

4. Foster Multisectoral Collaboration
- Integrate health, tech, and logistics sectors for efficient vaccine rollout and data sharing.  
- Leverage AI and mobile tech for contact tracing (e.g., India’s Aarogya Setu app).  

5. Address Equity Gaps  
- Support low-resource nations with funding and infrastructure to close testing/vaccination gaps.  
- Prioritize vulnerable populations in policy design (e.g., urban slums, rural areas).  

 

Final Outlook

The pandemic underscored the need for global solidarity, agile governance, and equitable health access**. By learning from these lessons, nations can build resilient systems to mitigate future crises.
